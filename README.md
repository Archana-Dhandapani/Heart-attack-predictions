# Heart-attack-predictions
The goal of using this heart dataset is often to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a person have heart attack or not based on the available features.
Explanation of each columns:

age: Age of the patient in years.

sex: Gender of the patient (0 for female, 1 for male).

cp: Chest pain type. This column likely represents different categories or levels of chest pain experienced by the patient, which might be measured on an ordinal scale.

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) measured at admission to the hospital.

chol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl) at admission to the hospital.

fbs: Fasting blood sugar level. This column likely indicates whether the patient had a fasting blood sugar level higher than 120 mg/dl (1 for yes, 0 for no).

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results. This column may represent different categories or levels of resting ECG results.

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved during the exercise test.

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 for yes, 0 for no). It indicates whether the patient experienced angina (chest pain or discomfort) during exercise.

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. This is a measure of how much the ST segment of the ECG changes during exercise compared to rest.

slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment. This likely represents different categories or levels of the slope of ST segment changes during exercise.

ca: The number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. This is often used as a measure of the number of blood vessels with significant narrowing.

thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (a categorical variable with different levels).

target: The target variable or the outcome you're trying to predict. In the context of heart disease prediction, this column typically indicates whether a patient has heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no).
